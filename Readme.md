# PdfStitch
A simple Golang utility to stich images and pdsf into one pdf.

## Story
My friend who was running online business as amazon seller, i noticed that he had labels in one page and invoice in one page, and both of them were very small so for every 1 order he would use 2 pages and most of that page was remaining empty. To reduce the paper wastage(i feel environmental concious sometimes) i wrote this simple utility. Now with this utility, 2 lables and 2 invoices are prited in the same page. **Hence saving 3 pages on every 2 orders. ** ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

## Usage
Drop whatsapp label image and invoice pdf into media directory. 
Then run the executable - `pdfstitch`.
It would generate new pdfs with name - `final{count}.pdf` you can go ahead and print this. 

**To compile**
```
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## Why on github
This is a demonstration of how to run shell scripts using golang.
